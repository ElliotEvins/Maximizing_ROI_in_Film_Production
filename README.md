## General Info
This project was assigned as the final project for Module 1 (Data Analysis) of Flatiron School's Immersive Data Science Program. The project centered around a hypothetical scenario in which Microsoft is interested in entering the movie production business. As a data scientist I was tasked with analyzing public movie databases (Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB, TMDB, and Box Office Mojo) and determining what makes a financially successful film. 

It was my decision to use return on investment as my primary metric for financial success. This allows us to disregard the effects of inflation and equally compare high budget and low budget films. A major assumption in this was that Microsoft's distribution model was to premier these films in theaters where they would earn most of their revenue. Furthermore, I elected to narrow my study down to only modern films since the year 2000. 

Basic analyses showed that making a profitable film is difficult.
