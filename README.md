## General Info
This project was assigned as the final project for Module 1 (Data Analysis) in Flatiron School's Immersive Data Science Program. The project centers around a hypothetical scenario in which Microsoft is interested in entering the movie production business. As a data scientist I have been tasked with analyzing public movie databases (Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB, TMDB, and Box Office Mojo) and determining what makes a financially successful film. 

It was my decision to use return on investment as the primary metric for financial success. This allows us to disregard the effects of inflation and equally compare high budget and low budget films. A major assumption in this analysis is that Microsoft's distribution model is to premier these films in theaters where they will earn most of their revenue. Furthermore, I am electing to narrow my study down to only modern films since the year 2000. 

Basic analyses show that making a profitable film is difficult.
